//Inheritance is used in cpp to remove repeativity of code
//DRY 
//using inheritance, we can get all properties of other class and 
//add additional features to it as per requirement

//existing class is called base class and the new class made is called derived class

//Forms of inheritance in cpp
/*
0- Single inheritance
    a derived class made from a base class
    A ------> B
    one      one
  parent     child

1- Multiple inheritance
    a derived class made from more than one base class
    A,B --------> C
    two          one
  parents       child

2- Hierarchical inheritance
    many derived class from a single class
    A ----------------->B,C
    one                many 
    parent            childs

3- Multilevel inheritance
    deriving a class from derived class
    A------------> B ----------> C
    parent       child         child of child

4- Hybrid inheritance 
    it is combination of different types of inheritance
    A --------> B,C ---------> D
